              <p>Virtual reality is not new. What's being sold to schools right now as VR is perhaps not even virtual reality. Rather it's stereoscopy with a more expensive device. It's the Android strapped to your forehead. The arguments for this technology echo those made at the turn of the 20th century for using films in class....</p>

              <p>In October 2015, the Obama Administration announced a new initiative that would allow coding bootcamps, MOOCs, and other ed-tech experiments to be eligible for federal financial aid. It's a bit odd, perhaps, that it would do this while also saying it's interested in cracking down on for-profit higher education. Here's a history to link this all together....</p>

              <p>Research arguing that <em>Sesame Street</em> is just as good as preschool has been making the rounds lately. One of the arguments: <em>Sesame Street</em> is the first MOOC. Nope. It wasn't. Indeed, <em>Sesame Street</em> is the opposite of what's become popularized as MOOCs. Because <em>Sesame Street</em> is actually based on research....</p>

              <p>The "factory model of education" is invoked to describe our current system of schooling, one that is -- like factories, I suppose -- outmoded. But the history of the "factory model," as told by Alvin Toffler and Salman Khan, is an invented one, not so much about education's past as its future....</p>

              <p>How did Apple come to dominate the education computing market in the 1980s?

He failed at the federal level, but he succeeded in California....</p>

Building from there with meaningless blackjack exercises? Yeah. Nope....</p>
